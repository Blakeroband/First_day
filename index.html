        <h2>Get to Know Me</h2>
        <p>I am 25 years old and currently enrolled in the U of M bootcamp for web development.
            In my spare time I like to play video games and hangout with my fiance. 
            I have 2 cats, 3 dogs, and 16 rabbits. A few years ago the list of animals I had would have been much longer and more diverse.
            I am very excited to learn to code because I find learning fun, and computer language is something that intrests me very much.
